# LPC17XX
## Implementation of Three Pulse canceller in MTI Processor using ARM
This is an Implementation of my bachelor thesis at University of Isfahan.
The purpose of this project is to design and implement simuator circuit which is similar to input of MTI radar. Here we use LPC1768 ARM Cortex m3 to 
sample data with DAC and 
detect the moving target with three pulse processing.
The simulator circuit diagram is shown below:

and the LPC1768 will implement the following algorithm:
